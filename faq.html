        <h2>Visitor's FAQs</h2>
        <button class="accordion">Do I need tickets?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>There is no need for tickets to see a parade...all of them are FREE!! That is why it is called "The
                Greatest Free Show on Earth!". You only get tickets if you want to sit down on stands as the parades
                pass.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion"> Is there an "official" Mardi Gras? </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe the
                claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website.
                Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do
                not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual
                parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the country, official
                organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">When does Mardi Gras start and end?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day
                (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.

                Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday
                is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
                Wednesday</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change
                from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly
                morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat
                dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want
                to bring a raincoat!</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Where can I book a room with a balcony to watch the parades go by?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The best option is to reserve a package in the French Quarter or along the parade route that offers a
                balcony, food and a bathroom pass.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why we call
                it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Are Carnival and Mardi Gras the same thing?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Technically, "Carnival" refers to the period of feasting and fun that begins on January 6 (see question
                below) and ends on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the final day of revelry before Ash Wednesday when Lent
                begins. It is also common for people to refer to the entire season as Mardi Gras and, for clarity, to
                call Fat Tuesday "Mardi Gras Day." Locals tend to call the season "Carnival" and, to us, the last two
                weekends leading up to Tuesday are"Mardi Gras."</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">What is Twelfth Night? </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Twelfth Night (aka, the Feast of the Epiphany and Three Kings' Day) is January 6th and is the official
                start of Mardi Gras every year. While the date of Fat Tuesday changes, Twelfth Night does not.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">When was the first Mardi Gras?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>IThe first Mardi Gras parade was held in New Orleans on Feb. 24, 1857 by the Krewe of Comus. They began
                the tradition of presenting a parade with floats and following it with a ball for the krewe and their
                guests.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">What is the significance of the Mardi Gras colors, and where did they come
            from?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Rex, the King of Carnival, selected the Mardi Gras colors and assigned meaning to them in 1892. Purple
                stands for justice, green for faith, and gold for power.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Why are masks worn?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>By law, float riders must always have a mask on. On Fat Tuesday, masking is legal for everyone else, and
                the elaborate masks that some wear add to the fun.
