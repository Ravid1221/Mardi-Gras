                in
                New
                Orleans is the adventure of a lifetime and, the more you know, the more fun you’ll have when you go.

                <h1>What is Mardi Gras? </h1>
                <p>Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. It's one big holiday in New
                    Orleans!
                    Revelers know
                    to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn themselves with long beads
                    caught from the
                    floats of previous parades.
                    You'll see a lot of crazy costumes, kids with their families are
                    everywhere,
                    and both locals
                    and visitors having a great time. Parade goers will sit on the ground, throw balls, play music, eat
                    great food and watch
                    the crowds walk by between parades.

                <h1>Mayor of New Orleans</h1>
                <p> Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier
                    University of Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive training
                    program at the Harvard Kennedy School. In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans
                    City Council seat vacated when former District B representative Stacy Head won an election to an
                    at-large position. After the November election, candidate Dana Kaplan and Cantrell advanced to a
                    December runoff, which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote. Cantrell served out the balance of
                    Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014. As a council member, Cantrell
                    focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She introduced a bill banning smoking at
                    restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of secondhand smoke on service
                    industry workers.The council unanimously passed the bill in 2015. As a member of the Criminal
                    Justice
                    Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to install crime cameras in her district, assess the
                    effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address understaffing at the New Orleans
                    Police Department. She does a lot for the city and supports the city activities.

                    <p> The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany,
                        also
                        called Twelfth Night or Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up
                        to
                        the
                        big event.

                        Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day.
                        Our
                        private Carnival clubs, called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads,
                        doubloons
                        and
                        toys to parade goers. Visitors quickly learn to say, "Throw me something mister!"


                        The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the
                        Zulu
                        Social
                        Aid & Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and
                        elaborate
                        costumes add to the fun-filled day of excitement for revelers of all ages.
                        New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting
                        place
                        to be at any time of the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in
                        their lifetime. Make your plans now to be a part of this great tradition and see firsthand
                        why
                        we say, "Laissez les bon temps rouler!" <br>

                On Mardi Gras day, the majority of non-essential businesses are shut
                down because of
                the celebration. Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can haul away
                all
                the
                beads and

                <p>
                    Mardi Gras, like Christmas, is a whole season - not just one day. That being said, Fat Tuesday is
                    the
                    biggest day of celebration, and the date it falls on moves around. You'll find that Fat Tuesday can
                    be any Tuesday between Feb. 3 and March 9. Carnival celebration starts on Jan. 6, the Twelfth Night
                    (feast of Epiphany), and picks up speed through midnight on Fat Tuesday, the day before Ash
                    Wednesday.
                    How do you know which Tuesday it will be?

                    Ash Wednesday is always 46 days before Easter, and Fat Tuesday is always the day before Ash
                    Wednesday. Easter can fall on any Sunday from March 23 to April 25, with the exact date to coincide
                    with the first Sunday after the full moon following a spring equinox.

                <h1>Know the new parade rules</h1>
                <p>
                    The New Orleans City Council passed new Mardi Gras parade rules in early 2014. Be sure
                    you
                    know
                    them
                    before you head out to the parades to avoid tickets, and to avoid bringing a bunch of
                    stuff
                    that
                    you'll
                    just have to move later. The new rules are as follows:

                    1. There can be no ladders or other personal effects, like grills and coolers, closer
                    than 6
                    feet to
                    the
                    curb.
                    2. Parking on Napoleon and St. Charles will be prohibited on BOTH sides of the neutral
                    ground
                    this
                    year,
                    not
                    just the parade side, starting 2 hours before the parade.
                    3. There is now a ban on roping off territory via chairs, tarps, or anything else if you
                    are
                    in
                    the
                    public
                    right of way. This includes neutral ground and
                    4. There can be no private portable toilets in the neutral ground or other public
                    property.

                <h1>Plan Your Transportation</h1>
                <p>
                    If you are driving in for the day from a suburban hotel, remember that the French
                    Quarter
                    during
                    Mardi
                    Gras weekend is closed to vehicular traffic. Only French Quarter residents and hotel
                    guests
                    with
                    special
                    parking passes can get by the police barricades. Off-site commercial parking lots are
                    expensive
                    and
                    fill
                    up fast, so get there early! Make sure you know how far away your hotel will be and
                    remember:
                    There
                    are
                    surcharges with rideshares and taxicabs are more difficult to find at this time of year.

                    It is a good idea to get a map of the city and study the areas you'll be visiting. New
                    Orleans
                    is a
                    "checkerboard city" - safe neighborhoods can be within blocks of unsafe areas. Your
                    hotel
                    concierge
                    or
                    front desk can help you with route times, traffic and parking.

                    If you stay in an outlying hotel, don't depend on them to supply you with transportation
                    to
                    the
                    French
                    Quarter or the parade routes. Although some have shuttles to New Orleans, they are often
                    not
                    in
                    use
                    during
                    Mardi Gras season. Traffic during Carnival is unbelievably congested, and standard
                    routes
                    are
                    often
                    barricaded to redirect the traffic flow.

                    Even public transportation can be difficult - bus and streetcar routes/schedules often
                    change
                    during
                    Carnival season, so plan ahead and make sure you know when and how to get there and
                    back.

                    If you want to save yourself some walking, bring a bicycle. Bicycles provide a great
